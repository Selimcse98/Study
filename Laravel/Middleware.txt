Step 1: Create RoleMiddleware by executing the following command:

Mohammads-MacBook-Air:quickstart-basic mohammadselimmiah$ php artisan make:middleware RoleMiddleware
Middleware created successfully.

Step 2: After successful execution, you will find
RoleMiddleware created in App\Http\Middleware.

Step 3: Add the following code in the handle method of the newly created RoleMiddleware
at app/Http/Middleware/RoleMiddleware.php.

<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;

class RoleMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next, $role)
    {
        echo "Role: ".$role;
        return $next($request);
    }
}


Step 4: Register the RoleMiddleware in app\Http\Kernel.php file.

 'Role' => \App\Http\Middleware\RoleMiddleware::class,

protected $routeMiddleware = [
        'auth' => \App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
        'auth.basic' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\AuthenticateWithBasicAuth::class,
        'guest' => \App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated::class,
        'throttle' => \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequests::class,
        'Role' => \App\Http\Middleware\RoleMiddleware::class,
    ];


Step 5: Execute the following command to create TestController:

Mohammads-MacBook-Air:quickstart-basic mohammadselimmiah$ php artisan make:controller TestController --resource
Controller created successfully.

Step 6: After successful execution, you will find TestController.php in App\Http\Controllers.

Step 7: Copy the following code to app/Http/TestController.php file.

<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Http\Requests;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class TestController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        echo "<br>Test Controller.";
    }

    public function create()
    {
    }

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
    }

    public function show($id)
    {
    }

    public function edit($id)
    {
    }

    public function update(Request $request, $id)
    {
    }

    public function destroy($id)
    {
    }
}


Step 8: Add the following line of code in app/Http/routes.php file

Route::get('role',[
'middleware' => 'Role:editor',
'uses' => 'TestController@index',
]);

Step 9: Visit the following URL to test the Middleware with parameters
http://localhost:8000/role

Step 10: The output will appear as shown in the following

Role: editor
Test Controller.



 =========================== Terminable Middleware ===========================
Step 1: Create TerminateMiddleware 


Mohammads-MacBook-Air:quickstart-basic mohammadselimmiah$ php artisan make:middleware TerminateMiddleware
Middleware created successfully.

Step 2: This will produce TerminateMiddleware.php in App\Http\Middleware

Step 3: Copy the following code in the newly created TerminateMiddleware at app/Http/Middleware/TerminateMiddleware.php

<?php
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;

class TerminateMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        echo "Executing statements of handle method of TerminateMiddleware.";
        return $next($request);
    }

    public function terminate($request, $response)
    {
        echo "<br>Executing statements of terminate method of TerminateMiddleware.";
    }
}

Step 4: Register the TerminateMiddleware in app\Http\Kernel.php file.

'terminate' => \App\Http\Middleware\TerminateMiddleware::class,

 protected $routeMiddleware = [
        'auth' => \App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
        'auth.basic' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\AuthenticateWithBasicAuth::class,
        'guest' => \App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated::class,
        'throttle' => \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequests::class,
        'Role' => \App\Http\Middleware\RoleMiddleware::class,
        'terminate' => \App\Http\Middleware\TerminateMiddleware::class,
    ];

Step 5: Execute the following command to create ABCController.

php artisan make:controller ABCController


Mohammads-MacBook-Air:quickstart-basic mohammadselimmiah$ php artisan make:controller ABCController
Controller created successfully.

Step 6: This will produce ABCController.php in App\Http\Controllers

Step 7: Copy the following code to app/Http/ABCController.php file.

<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Http\Requests;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class ABCController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        echo "<br>ABC Controller.";
    }
}

Step 8: Add the following line of code in app/Http/routes.php file.

Route::get('terminate',[
'middleware' => 'terminate',
'uses' => 'ABCController@index',
]);


Step 9: Visit the following URL to test the Terminable Middleware.
http://localhost:8000/terminate

Step 10: The output will appear as shown in the following

Executing statements of handle method of TerminateMiddleware.
ABC Controller.
Executing statements of terminate method of TerminateMiddleware.
